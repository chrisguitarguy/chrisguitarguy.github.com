                    Marketing: the art of manipulating people into doing what you want.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Maybe that's a bit overboard.  A more traditional definition of marketing is <em>the action or business of promtoing and selling products or services</em>.  Sound pleasant.  Let's talk about some things you should know about marketing -- especially marketing online.
                </p>
                
                <p><em>Note: when I say "marketer" in this article, it refers to a very broad set of people. Conversion optimizers, SEOs, PPC gurus, ecommerce strategists, etc.</em></p>
                
                <h2>1. Everything is Marketing</h2>
                
                <p>Literally everything is marketing.  The way a website is designed?  Marketing. The color of that button in the header?  Marketing.  That post on Facebook from your favorite shoe company? Marketing.  The social sharing buttons at the top of this post?  Marketing.</p>
                
                <p>Your attention is a finite resource, and companies want it.  Whenever you see something, assume that someone wanted you to see it.  Which leads to point two...</p>
                
                <h2>2. You Are Being Watched</h2>
                
                <p>There's a thing about marketers: they love data. Marketers love data because it tells them things about you, and, more specifically, it tells them how they can do better the next time.  Marketers are always getting better at making sure <em>you</em> take the action they desire.</p>
                
                <h2>3. You Are Not Immune</h2>
                
                <p>Despire you protests tha you can be manipulated and no matter what your education level or general intelligence, you are not immune to marketing.  You may have a more finely tuned bullshit detector, but it doesn't apply to all situations.  Just because you didn't fall for that "read it free for 30 days!" deal doesn't mean you're immune to marketing.  Instead, assume that you're ignoring the fact you're being marketed to because something fits into your worldview.</p>
                
                <p>Need an example? Organic food. No one needs to buy organic food, yet people do. If you're an organic food proponent, now is the part where you brain screams that organic is more healthy. Your brain is also probably telling you something about how grass fed [insert animal] are treated better. Consider that train of thought is one that the marketer who thought up the organic label wants you to have. Should you stop buying organic food?  That's not really the point of this article.  Just be aware that you are not immune to someones influence, you just choose to ignore the fact that you are not immune when it fits into your particular worldview.</p>
                
                <h2>4. You Are Being Manipulated</h2>
                
                <p>Ever clicked on a link on an ecommerce website?  The answer to that question is probabably yes. You can safely assume that a marketer wanted you to click on that link.</p>
                
                <p>Let's take that one step further.  Let's say you enter an ecommerce website through a pay per click ad. When you enter than site, the marketer behind that ad now knows a lot about you.  That content you see at the top of the site?  "FREE SHIPPING" or whatever it happens to be? That was probably placed there to ease friction and help you convert. Did you search for a product on that same site?  Chances are the in site search results were manipulated to place products you're interested in (remember: you came from a certain term) towards the top of the results. The list could go on here, but the general point is this: someone is directing your actions.  It's not the government or some giant conspiracy. It's just a very smart person who is collecting a lot of data (see number 2) and knows that no one is immune (see number 3).</p>
                
                <h2>5. You Are Not a Rebel</h2>
                
                <p>By far the easiest, most effective marketing win of all time is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1841126551/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=theclaguiblo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1841126551" target="_blank">Rebel Sell</a> (aff).  The goal: convince you that by taking some action you are setting yourself apart from the mainstream.  Of course if enough people decide this is the case, the folks who thought they were a unique, beautiful snowflake move on to greener pastures.  They seek the next thing that sets them apart and the process begins again.</p>
                
                <p>The classic example of this is clothing. And the classic example of clothing is that gears towards "punks" or the counter culture.  Let's not pick on that, it's too easy.</p>
                
                <p>You want to get a job at a start up.  Why?  Is it better and more secure than working for an established enterprise company?  Probably not.  Do you get to work on more interesting problems? Probably yes.</p>
                
                <p>But, more importantly, working for a startup provides you with a way into a life billed as the anti-corporation.  Beer on Fridays?  Awesome.  Free lunches and gym memberships?  Sweet. That would never happen in corporate America (true story). At the end of the day, you'll still be doing something for a wage. When you look at it in the abstract like that, it's not as sexy. It's HR's job to convince you that working some place is in your best interests.  One of the ways they can do that is by influencing your perception. Most companies are not aware they do this, but because everything is marketing (see number 1) they indeed are.</p>
                
                <p>The larger point here is that the rebel sell is used to manipulate people into performing certain actions and acting certain ways (see number 4).  When that happens you become more predictable, marketers collect more data (number 2) and getter better at influencing you.</p>
                
                <h2>But I'm Different! For Real!</h2>
                
                <p>Probably not. But you'll talk yourself into believing that you are (number 5).</p>
                
                <p>The point of this post is not to call out people for acting in certain ways.  I don't think any of the above is a bad thing unless used unethically.  The bottom line is that a marketer some where wants you to take a certain action because, if they're good, they believe that you are a perfect fit for what they are selling.</p>
                
                <p>That's why start ups continue to be the rebels: because it attracts the people they want to hire.  It's also why folks buy organic food: because it fits into the image they want themselves to have.</p>
                
                <p>Marketing is manipulative and easily used for [insert something you don't like].  But it's also something that drives people towards products and services that fit with them. Not a bad thing, if done correctly.</p>
